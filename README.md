Description of memory.py

memory.py is a program for playing the game memory (concentration). It is a
single player version of the game where the player must match cards in a
standard deck of 52. Two cards are considered matched if they have the same
rank and color. The player's best score is tracked for the duration of
running the program. A Card class was implemented to easily keep track of
the rank, suit, and color of each card. The code is structured in a modular

pandas,
numpy,
sys,
random,
time,
